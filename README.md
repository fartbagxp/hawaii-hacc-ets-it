# Hawaii Hackathon Notes

The Hawaii Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) would like to create a SOH executive branch IT Portfolio & Roadmap Visualization.

## History

This project is at least partly aligned with the continuation of the [ETS's SharpCloud project](https://ets.hawaii.gov/disclaimer/), a project for IT cost transparency. The ETS's SharpCloud project became a overburden project on project managers over time. The goal is to have a simplier view of government systems.

Hawaii State employees has access to an internal portal with more data but the portal is not accessible by the public.

## Acronyms

- (nice to have) Figure out what is lacking
- More specifically, be able to answer critical questions
  - What's a project currently underfunded, but important enough to be modernized?
